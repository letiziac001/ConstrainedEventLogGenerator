def get_prefix_proba_constrained(case_study: str, alphabet: list, event_seqs: list, k = 0):
    
    """
    Computes the constrained transition system and the corresponding prefix probability dictionary.

    This function builds a transition system from event sequences, converts it to an NFA,
    intersects it with a constraint automaton, prunes unreachable final states, and finally
    computes a new constrained transition system.

    Args:
        case_study (str): Identifier for the specific case study or constraint set to apply.
        alphabet (List[str]): The list of activities that will be used in the NFAs.
        event_seqs (list[list[str]]): The list of event sequences.
        k (int): Prefix length for transition system generation. 

    Returns:
        tuple:
            - set: The pruned alphabet from the final automaton.
            - dict: Dictionary representing the constrained transition system with probabilities.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the intersection of the transition system and the constraints results in
                    no valid final states, indicating overly restrictive constraints.
